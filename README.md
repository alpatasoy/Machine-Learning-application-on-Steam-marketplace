Salutes,

This is an attempt at developing an end-to-end solution to a real life problem example.
The dataset is retrieved from kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset
Here, I will try to further refine this study. You are more than welcome to provide any learning opportunities.
I also look forward to your insights.
Note:   I have removed personal opinions, insights and domain expertise as much as possible to better see the methods i've utilized.
        I also would like to exchange opinions on the proposed solution outcomes and methods I've used in a discussion.

Special thanks to my mom (of course), and to my Data Science teachers.
